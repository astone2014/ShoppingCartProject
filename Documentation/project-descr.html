Please send your questions to icardei@cse.fau.edu.
<P>

<H2>Application Topic</H2>

Students will develop an application from scratch applying the OO development
process studied in Chapter 2. Reusing a project from another course is not allowed. 
<BR/>
Students have two options for the application topic.


<H3>Application Option #1: Shopping Cart</H3>

Develop a shopping cart application (think of a simplified version of amazon.com).
When the application begins, it shows a login window.<BR>
Depending who logs in, a customer or the seller, the application performs different functions.<BR/>
<P>

<H4>Draft Functional Specification:</H4>

A customer logs in with a user name and password and a window (frame) opens where he can browse <BR/>
through a list of available products that includes the product name, price, and available quantity. <BR/>
From this window the customer can select products and add them to the shopping cart
or they can click on a product and get the full <BR/>
product description, pricing and availability (quantity available) in a pop-up window. The <BR/>
customer can add the product to the shopping cart (quantity), depending on availability.  <BR/>
The shopping cart total amount is kept current on the main product browse window.
<P><P>

The customer can proceed to checkout at any time. On the checkout window, the shopping<BR/>
cart can be updated by changing the item count for each product in the cart. At checkout<BR/>
the customer verifies the shopping cart content and pays for the goods by  <BR/>
supplying the credit card. The application does not arrange for shipping.
<P/><P>

When the seller logs in, a window opens where the current state of the inventory is shown. <BR/>
The seller can update the inventory by adding products - specifying product name, invoice price, <BR/>
sell price and by updating the available quantity.<BR/>
<P>

The internal product representation includes ID, type, quantity, invoice price, and  <BR/>
selling price. The application must keep track of all costs, revenues and profits.<BR/>
The seller can access this information from the application UI.
<BR/><BR/><BR/>
FYI:<BR/>
Profit = Revenues - Costs, <BR/>
Revenues = Sum of sell price for all sold items<BR>
Costs = Sum of invoice price for all items brought in the inventory (bought)
<BR/>

<H3>Application Option #2: Custom</H3>
Students can come up with their own idea for a project that has similar level of complexity with Option #1.<BR/>
The implementation must use Java and could be a:
<UL>
      <LI>desktop application with Java Swing GUI (or equivalent)</LI>
      <LI>Android application</LI>
      <LI>peer-to-peer or distributed application</LI>
      <LI>combination of the above</LI>
</UL>
Completing the project phases should be feasible within the time frame indicated below for milestones.

<H2>Mandatory Project Requirements for all Options</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Use the Model-View-Controller architecture for handling the GUI and changes <BR>
to the models (for option #1: shopping cart, inventory, costs/revenue/profit).
<LI>Use at least <B>FOUR</B> different design patterns. <BR/>
Highlight the patterns and
describe the pattern roles for classes <BR>
in the design documents (UML) and in the  javadoc comments.
<LI>Use programming by contract. Specify the contract with javadoc comments on methods.
<LI>Write unit tests with JUnit and use them.
<LI>Use javadoc comments and submit the generated html files in the <TT>project/javadocs</TT>
directory.
</UL>

<H3>Specific requirements for Option #1 projects </H3>
<UL>
<LI>Abstract the credit card payment process. Assume all payments are successful.
<LI>The application graphical user interface should use Swing classes or html.
<LI>The product/user databases must be persistent,<BR>
meaning that when the user closes the application, then 
restarts it, the state of the product inventory must be restored. Use a text file, or <BR>
Java Serialization for storing the product and user database (seller and customer(s)).<BR>
The initial state of the product and user databases are not specified, and could be <BR>
pre-populated with objects.
</UL>


<H2>Teaming</H2>
Students must work in teams of two and can pick their partners. A Project Teaming discussion 
board forum is available to assist finding partners.

<BR/>
<BR/>

<H2>Grading Rubric</H2>
<OL>
<LI>20% - Requirements Specification
<LI>40% - Design Specification</LI>
<LI>30% - Implementation - application code, unit tests
<LI>10% - Demo. The application should work.
</OL>
<BR/>


The instructor will review early deliverables for items 1 and 2 and will return feedback<bR/>
and a grade. Students have to go back and use the comments to improve their requirements and<bR/>
the design for the next submission. <BR>
The final grade for the requirements specification and for the design will be the mean of grade from  <bR/>
the initial submission and the grade  for the final submission.<BR/>
<br/>


<H2>Milestones and Deliverables</H2>
<H3>0. Teaming and Topic</H3>
Students should select by <FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+1">01/24/2016</FONT>
the team members  and the project topic <BR/>.
One member of each group should use the BB Messaging tool to send a message to the instructor <BR/>
with their project topic and title. If a group picks Option #2 (custom project) then they should<BR/>
write a more detailed description of their project. Make sure to include what the program is doing,<BR/>
who are the intended users, what platform and OS are needed.<BR/><BR/>

Each group will be assigned a group ID, will get a group page on BB, and will use BB's Blog, Wiki, and<BR/>
Journal tools for sharing files and for recording their progress. <BR/>
<B>However, all project deliverables MUST use the group's Blog tool on BB.</B>

during office hours in the final week of the semester. Time TBA.</B>
<BR/></LI>
<LI>Create a zip file with the following:

</UL>
<P/>

<H3>Final Delivery Instructions</H3>
Create the following directory structure:
<PRE>
project
   \
    docs
   \
    javadocs
   \
    bin
   \
    src
        \
        cop4331   (package directories)
</PRE>
Break down the Java code in several packages (cop4331.gui, cop4331.client, ...). Place the Java packages in <BR/>
the <TT>project/cop4331/prj</TT> directory.<BR>
Put in <TT>project/docs</TT> all analysis and design PDF documents, and <B>one PDF document</B> <BR/>
that has has the updated requirements, design, and all source code, with .java file names properly identified.<BR/>
The code pasted in this PDF file must be easily readable. Use font size 9 to 12. Don't use Courier <BR/>
font because it's too wide. Check out 
<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3252098/what-is-the-best-way-to-insert-source-code-examples-into-a-microsoft-word-docume">this</A> 
page to find out how to format code in Word.<BR/> It seems some IDEs can export (or copy/paste) in RTF format and Word takes that.<BR/>
Understand that the instructor must find reading your diagrams and code interesting and refreshing. <BR/>
If readability becomes a problem,  frustration accumulates and your grade may suffer. <BR/><BR/>

For all documents submitted identify each team member's contribution. For code, use Javadoc comment tag @author.<BR/><BR/>

For the final delivery zip the project base directory with the <B><TT>zip</TT></B> program <BR>
(Winzip, explorer, or <TT>zip</TT> on Linux) and upload the file <I>project.zip</I> on the project <B>Blog</B> page.<BR/>
In addition, <B>upload on the Blog page the PDF file with the final report.</B><BR/><BR/>

<I>Only submissions in these approved formats will be graded.</I> Other formats (e.g. arj, rar, 7z, DOC, RTF, HTML, etc.)
will get you 0 points with no possibility of regrading.
<BR/><BR/>

Please make sure you describe in a <TT>project/readme.txt</TT> file instructions on how to build <BR>
and run the application.<BR>
<BR>
If you use Eclipse, Netbeans, or BlueJ, you can copy-paste the source (src) directory in the project directory.
<BR/>
Be sure it includes all source files.
<BR/>
<P>

<H2>Some advice:</H2>
  <UL>
    <LI>Check out the Project Q & A file and the other advice files posted on the Project BB page.</LI>
    <LI>A good example for MVC and pattern use for a similar (but smaller) application is <BR>
      the invoice example from Chapter 5 in the textbook. See the
      <A HREF="http://wisenet.fau.edu/class/cop4331/notes/Ch5/Ch5.html">notes</A> and the 
      <A HREF="http://wisenet.fau.edu/class/cop4331/notes/Ch5/code/invoice/">code</A>.
<!--  <LI>Abstract the user interface in your design. See how the textbook voice mail<BR/>
      example from Chapter 2  does it. Use the MVC architecture to decouple the UI from the application logic.
-->
